    "To clarify, 4. the principle of relativity: some people think that uniform velocity doesn't affect the properties of an object, but this is false; for example when light is moving uniformly toward you it is blue shifted, and when it is moving uniformly away from you it is red shifted. The principle states that the basic laws of physics work the same in any inertial frame of reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a FOR, $f_1$, a ball is moving at a fixed velocity $v_1$. Later we change our FOR to $f_2$, where the ball is moving at the same fixed velocity $v_1$. The principle of relativity claims that the measure properties will be the same in both $f_1$ and $f_2$, as long as the ball remains the same. But, what does remain the same mean? For practical purposes I won't try to answer that, let's just keep it ideal."

    "How can I measure the speed of an object? We can have a racetrack where we known the distance between start and end points, then we initiate the clock at the start line and stop it when the object crosses the finish line. This cannot be accurate though because an observer must see the object go to the finish line, which will be delayed because the speed of light is not instantaneous. We could have a second clock at the finish line that stops exactly when the object crosses, but then the start and end clocks must be synchronized. I don't know why but that might be impossible. Time and distance might vary based on the speed of an object relative to a frame of reference. A clever way to get around this is to have a photon and a mirror at the finish line so that the photon bounces back and meets the ball again. Depending on how far the ball has travel we can calculate its speed relative to the photon.\n",
