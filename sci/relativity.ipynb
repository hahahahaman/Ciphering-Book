The principle states that the object's properties are the same in all frames of reference which are moving uniformly with the object; for example, if a light is seen as yellow when it is stationary, then, when it is moving in uniform motion, it will be guarenteed to be yellow in a frame of reference that is uniformly moving with it."

    "\n",
    "How can I measure the speed of an object? We can have a racetrack where we known the distance between start and end points, then we initiate the clock at the start line and stop it when the object crosses the finish line. This cannot be accurate though because an observer must see the object go to the finish line, which will be delayed because the speed of light is not instantaneous. We could have a second clock at the finish line that stops exactly when the object crosses, but then the start and end clocks must be synchronized. I don't know why but that might be impossible. Time and distance might vary based on the speed of an object relative to a frame of reference. A clever way to get around this is to have a photon and a mirror at the finish line so that the photon bounces back and meets the ball again. Depending on how far the ball has travel we can calculate its speed relative to the photon.\n",
