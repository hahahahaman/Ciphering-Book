We know this because the sides of the square will be coordinates $(x,y)$ that satisfy $|x|+|y| = 2^{k+1}-1$ (we are using base 2, so if $|x|$ increases by 1, then $|y|$ will decrease by $1$, and vice-versa).

    "\n",
    "What is $|P_k|$? In the center row we have $2(2^k-1+1) = 2^{k+1}$ points, and each row above and below decreases by $1$. So we have $2(\\sum_{i=1}^{2^{k+1}-1} i) + 2^{k+1} = 2(\\sum_{i=1}^{E} i) + 2^{k+1} = 2 \\frac{E(E+1)}{2} + 2^{k+1} = (2^{k+1}-1)(2^{k+1}) + 2^{k+1} = 4^{k+1} - 2^{k+1} + 2^{k+1} = 4^{k+1}$.\n",

    "We know that the sum of the coordinates must all have the same parity. If they do, then it's possible, if they do not, then it is impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see from the induction proof that we can always go from $P_k$ to $P_{k-1}$ by a translation of $2^k$, because at least one direction of `L, R, D, U` must map from $P_k = P_{k-1, \\pm2^k}$ to $P_{k-1}$. Thus we iterate from the longest segment, the segment of length $2^{30}$, to the shortest segment, 1, checking each direction to see if the translation moves to point into $P_{k-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the proof above we explain the problem for odd points only, but to reiterate, we can do the same method for even points, we just need to add an additional segment of length $1$ to get $\\{1, 1, 2, ..., 2^k\\}$."
