Then the black children will give $Y_v = \\sum{Y_{w_i}} + \\sum{X_{b_j}}$. The other, more subtle, criteria is that we should maximize $X_\\omega$, because it minimizes $Y_v$. Why minimize $Y_v$? We know $X_v$ will be invariant, but if $Y_v$ is minimized it is clear that it'll be easier to fit it into a sum higher in the tree. Greedily we should say that no solution can be better than when $Y_v$ is minimized.\n",
